Python script (back-end) created by **Dimitrios Panourgias**
<br/> The script is based on an example python script from Google's Adwords API documentation
<br/> June 2020

:children_crossing: *This script is not maintained, so, in time, certain operations or even the entire script may not be functional.* 
<br/> :space_invader: *Also the script is not tested to handle all cases and exceptions (but if you follow the inpput guidelines it shall work fine).*

This script **can only work if you have gained Basic or Standard Access to Adwords API.**
<br/> Note that for test ad accounts this script will return dummy data.
<br/> **Keep always in mind that the displayed stats are ESTIMATIONS provided by Google.**

<br/> **Scope of the script:**
<br/> - Specify a list of potential keywords and each one's match type.
<br/> - Specify in the script the Location code, Language code and Max CPC of a fictitious ad group.
<br/> - Run the script and get a datatable with each keyword along with estimated mean daily clicks, estimated mean average position (though deprecated according to Google) and estimated mean avg. CPC

<br/> **Further actions**
<br/> - The script can be modified according to your needs
<br/> - The aforementioned stats can be broken down to their min and max values
<br/> - Other metrics tht can be retrieved are impressions, cost, etc.
